### Task Manager using JIVAS

The **Task Manager** is a simple Single-Agentic Application built to demonstrate how agent-based systems can be created in the **Jaseci ecosystem**.

This example project is implemented in **two different ways**, using the two available frameworks/tools in Jaseci:

- **[JIVAS](https://github.com/TrueSelph/jivas)** – Jaseci’s agent framework  
- **[byLLM (Meaning-Typed Programming)](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac-byllm/with_llm)** – a tool-centric agentic framework  

For more context, see the [overview README](./task_manager/README.md).
