## About Jac

Jac is a revolutionary programming language that introduces **Object-Spatial Programming (OSP)**, where computation moves to data rather than data moving to computation. This enables naturally distributed and scale-agnostic applications.

### Key Features:
- **Nodes**: Stateful entities that hold data
- **Edges**: Typed relationships between nodes
- **Walkers**: Mobile computation that traverses graphs
- **Scale-Agnostic**: Same code runs locally and in cloud
- **AI-Native**: Built-in LLM integration via MTLLM
- **Type-Safe**: Mandatory type annotations

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install Jac
pip install jaclang

# Run a Jac program
jac run myprogram.jac

# Serve as web API
jac serve myprogram.jac
```

### Hello World
```jac
with entry {
    print("Hello, Jac World!");
}
```

### Object-Spatial Example
```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

walker Greeter {
    can greet with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    alice = root ++> Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    bob = alice ++> Person(name="Bob", age=25);
    
    Greeter() spawn root;
}
```

## Usage Instructions

These cheat sheets are designed for:
1. **LLM Reference**: Provide these to language models for accurate Jac code generation
2. **Developer Reference**: Quick syntax lookup during development
3. **Learning Resource**: Structured introduction to Jac concepts

Each cheat sheet includes:
- ‚úÖ Complete, runnable code examples
- üìù Clear explanations of syntax
- üîß Practical patterns and use cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Common pitfalls and best practices

## Examples Organization

Examples progress from basic to advanced:
- **Basic Syntax**: Fundamental language features
- **Object-Spatial**: Core Jac paradigm concepts  
- **AI Integration**: Modern LLM-powered development
- **Advanced Features**: Power-user capabilities
- **Cloud Deployment**: Production-ready patterns
