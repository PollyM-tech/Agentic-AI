# Jac Programming Language Keyword Reference

 Keywords are special reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language and cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or other objects. In Jac, all the keywords that exist in Python can also be used.

## 1. Archetype and Data Structure Keywords

These keywords define the core data and structural elements in Jac, forming the foundation for graph-based and object-oriented programming.

**Core Archetype Keywords**

| Keyword | Description |

| [`obj`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#archetype-types) | Defines a standard object, similar to a Python class, for holding data and behaviors. |
| [`node`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#archetype-types) |Represents a vertex or location in a graph, capable of storing data.|
| [`edge`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#archetype-types)|Defines a directed connection between two nodes, which can have its own attributes and logic. |
| [`walker`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#archetype-types) | A mobile computational agent that traverses the graph of nodes and edges to process data. |
| [`class`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#archetype-types)  |Defines a standard Python-compatible class, allowing for seamless integration with the Python ecosystem. |
| [`enum`](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac_ref/#enumerations)  |Creates an enumeration, a set of named constants. |

## 4. Control Flow and Logic Keywords

These keywords direct the path of execution, enabling conditional logic, loops, and error handling.

**Control Flow Statements**

## 6. Concurrency and Asynchronous Keywords

These keywords are used to manage concurrent and asynchronous operations for non-blocking execution.

**Asynchronous Operations**

!!! tip "Keyword Usage Guidelines"
    - **Reserved words**: Keywords cannot be used as variable or function names
    - **Case sensitive**: All keywords must be written in lowercase
    - **Context matters**: Some keywords are only valid in specific contexts (e.g., walker keywords)
    - **Type safety**: Many keywords work with Jac's type system for better code reliability
